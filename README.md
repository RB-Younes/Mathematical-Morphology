# Mathematical Morphology 

This repository contains implementations of Mathematical-Morphology  functions as part of the TP Mathematical-Morphology. The functions include image dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and morphological gradient.

## Implemented Functions

### Dilation (`dilate`)

The `dilate` function performs dilation operation on a gray scale image using a structuring element.

### Erosion (`erode`)

The `erode` function performs erosion operation on a gray scale image using a structuring element.

### Opening (`open`)

The `open` function performs opening operation on a gray scale image using a structuring element.

### Closing (`close`)

The `close` function performs closing operation on a gray scale image using a structuring element.

### Morphological Gradient (`morphologicalGradient`)

The `morphologicalGradient` function computes the morphological gradient of an gray scale image using a structuring element.

These functions are designed for educational purposes and may require further optimization or customization for specific applications. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
